Graham McTavish was born on January 4, 1961 in Glasgow, Scotland. As a child, he left his homeland with his family, and since then lived in different parts of the world, including Canada, the USA and England, until he settled in New Zealand. Even at school, McTavish became interested in stage productions. Together with a friend, they wrote and performed comedy sketches, thanks to which McTavish was noticed by a school drama teacher and invited him to replace a sick actor in one of the productions. After high school, McTavish studied at Queen Mary University of London, after which he received a degree in English literature. During his studies at the university, he participated in several Shakespeare plays, thanks to which he received a member card of the Actors Association.
