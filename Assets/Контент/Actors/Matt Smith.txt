Matt Smith was born on October 28, 1982 in the English city of Northampton. His parents, Lynn and David Smith, own a small plastics recycling business, and his older sister, Laura Jane, is a dancer. She toured for a long time with the popular British band Take That, and also starred in the famous video for Eric Prydz's song "Call on Me", where she played one of the dancers.

Smith received his primary education at Northampton Boys' School and later attended Alton College. He planned to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and father by becoming a professional football player. Starting from the age of 11, he was a member of the youth squads of Northampton Town, Nottingham Forest and Leicester City football clubs (he even became captain in the latter), but at the age of 16 he received a back injury that prevented him from continuing his sports career.

Smith's acting talent was considered by his school drama teacher, who repeatedly enrolled Mat in various theatrical productions without his knowledge and eventually persuaded him to join London's National Youth Theatre.

Smith combined his theater studies with a visit to the University of East Anglia in Norwich, where he studied drama and creative writing. Even during his studies, he managed to acquire his own agent and get his first professional roles, because of which he was forced to switch to distance learning in his last year.
