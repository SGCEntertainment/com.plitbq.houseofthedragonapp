Olivia Cooke was born on December 27, 1993 in Oldham, England. Her mother, Lindsey Wilde, was a sales representative and her father, John Cook, was a retired police officer. After her parents divorced, Olivia and her younger sister Eleanor stayed with their mother.

Olivia began studying acting at the age of 8, attending extracurricular classes at the Oldham Theater Workshop. She then attended the Royton and Crompton Academy and studied drama at Oldham College. She never finished college, dropping out to star in the BBC One mini-series Blackout.

Despite the fact that already at the beginning of her acting career, Olivia had enough job offers, she really wanted to enter the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and reached the last round of auditions, but in the end she was not accepted.
