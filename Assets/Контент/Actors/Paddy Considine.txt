Paddy Considine was born on September 5, 1973 in the small English town of Burton upon Trent, where he grew up with his brother and four sisters. He attended local schools, including Abbot Bain High School, before attending Burton College in 1990, where he first met Shane Meadows, a future filmmaker and screenwriter.

Considine and Meadows took an acting course together, but neither of them ever graduated. Dropping out after their first year, they formed the rock band She Talks To Angels, with Considine on drums and Meadows on vocals. But soon the young people returned to their studies: Meadows left for Nottingham in 1993, and Considine went to study photography at the University of Brighton in 1994.

At the University of Brighton, Paddy Considine studied under British documentary photographer Paul Ries. The training did not go very smoothly, and one day Considine even faced the threat of expulsion. But in the end, he solved his problems and still got a higher education, graduating from the university with a bachelor's degree.
