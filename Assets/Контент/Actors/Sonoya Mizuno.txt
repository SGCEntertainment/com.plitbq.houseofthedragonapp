Sonoya Mizuno was born in 1987 in Tokyo, Japan. Her father was Japanese and her mother was half British and half Argentine. Shortly after the birth of their daughter, the family moved to the UK. Sonoy's childhood was spent in the countryside of Somerset. A few years after the move, her parents separated and her father returned to Japan. The mother of the actress died when she was 13 years old.

Sonoi's uncle Mizuno was an actor, and her niece wanted to follow in his footsteps since childhood. He advised her to take up dancing, which was supposed to help her achieve this goal. Mizuno graduated from the Royal Ballet School and has since worked with several companies, including the Dresden Semperoper Ballet and Scottish Ballet.
