Steve Toussaint was born on March 22, 1965 in the English city of Birmingham. His parents were immigrants from the island of Barbados. When Steve was 4 years old, he moved to London with his family. He spent his childhood on an estate in the southeast of the city (New Cross area). After leaving school, Toussaint entered the University of Sussex in the department of political science. The boy was drawn to the stage from an early age and he was a regular participant in school theater productions. There was also a place for him in the university theater.

After university, Toussaint worked for some time in a merchant bank. He did not really like the job, so he soon left it and went to the USA, where he spent 3 months doing nothing special. Upon returning to London, Steve seriously thought about the career of an actor. He did not have enough money to study in theater schools, and he found a way out by joining the theater troupe of his former teacher. Soon Toussaint got his first professional role: he played the genie in the production of "Aladdin", which took place at the Churchill Theater (Bromley) from 1990 to 1991.
