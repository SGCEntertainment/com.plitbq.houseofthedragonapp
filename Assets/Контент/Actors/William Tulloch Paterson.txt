William Tulloch Paterson was born in Glasgow on June 3, 1945. Paterson grew up in Dennistoun to a father who was a plumber and a mother who was a barber. He claims that his interest in acting began with a school trip to the Civic Theater in Gorbals in 1961. However, after high school he decided to first pursue a career based on an interest in architecture and spent three years as an apprentice surveyor before deciding to attend the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.
