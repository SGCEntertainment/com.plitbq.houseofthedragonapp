Laris Strong is Lord of Harrenhal and head of House Strong. Second son of Lord Lionel Strong and younger brother of Ser Harvin Strong.

background
Laris was born with a clubfoot (a birth defect in which one or both feet are turned inward and down), so he walks with a cane. He is known for being mysterious and cunning, but is underestimated by those around him due to his frail appearance. The older brother Larisa Harvin always protects him.
