Leynor Velaryon is the son of Corlis Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen, heir to Driftmark. Dragonrider Seasmoke.

Biography
Laynor's maternal grandfather and father Rhaenys Targaryen Aemon Targaryen was the eldest son and heir of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. Aemon died before Jaehaerys, but Jaehaerys refused to recognize Rhaenys as heir due to her gender and chose his youngest son Balon as heir. Balon died a few years later, after which the king wanted to appoint his grandson Viserys as the new heir. However, a number of great houses held that Leynor should be the heir on the basis of primogeniture. To avoid civil war, the aged Jaehaerys convened the Great Council of 101 in Harrenhal, in which all the lords of Westeros took part. Viserys won the final vote by a wide margin and ascended the throne a few years after Jaehaerys's death. At the beginning of Viserys's reign, tensions remain in the kingdom, as many believe that Laynor was deceived from the throne by deceit.
