House of the Dragon: Season 1
When Rayneera and Leynor return to their quarters in the Red Keep with the newborn Joffrey, they find Luke and Jace playing with Harwin. Luke and his brother show them the dragon egg Luke chose for his new brother. He asks to hold Joffrey, but Laynor instead takes him and Jace back to the Dragonpit for training. There, Luke, Jace, and Aegon play a trick on Aymond, who doesn't yet have a dragon, by offering him a pig dressed up as a dragon. Later, Luceris trains with weapons with Jace, Aegon, and Aymond in the courtyard of the Red Keep under Ser Kriston Kohl. Some time later, Luke, along with Rainira, Jace, and baby Joffrey, see off Ser Harvin Strong, who is sent to Harrenhal after he is dismissed from his post as commander of the city guard. Luke himself later leaves King's Landing with his mother, brothers and father, and together they go to Dragonstone so that Rayneera takes her rightful place as heir to the Iron Throne.
