Biography
Rhaenys Targaryen is the granddaughter of Jaehaerys I Targaryen and the cousin of Viserys I Targaryen and Daemon Targaryen. Rhaenys is named after her grandfather Jaehaerys's grandmother Rhaenys Targaryen, sister-wife of Aegon the Conqueror.

Rhaenys married Korlys Velaryon, admiral of the Targaryen fleet and currently the richest man in Westeros, who made his fortune on the trading expeditions he personally made to the east. Rhaenys and Corlis have two children: a daughter, Leina Velaryon, and a son, Leynor Velaryon.

Rhaenys' father Aemon predeceased her grandfather, King Jaehaerys, after which Jaehaerys made the controversial decision to name his youngest son Balon as heir - despite the fact that according to the traditional law of succession based on primogeniture, a lord's daughter should inherit before her younger brother. Because of this, Rhaenys was nicknamed "The Queen That Wasn't". However, Jaehaerys's youngest son died a few years later, during Jaehaerys' lifetime, leaving two male rivals in contention for the Iron Throne: Rhaenys' own son Leynor (based on primogeniture) and Rhaenys Viserys's cousin (son of Jaehaerys's youngest son based on male continuity). lines). Fearing civil war, Jaehaerys convened the Great Council of 101 in Harrenhal, in which all the lords of Westeros participated, and in the course of a vote they chose Viserys as heir to the throne. A few years later, Jaehaerys died of old age, and Viserys ascended the throne.

After Rhaenys lost twice in the fight for the crown, she became estranged from the royal court of her cousin Viserys.
