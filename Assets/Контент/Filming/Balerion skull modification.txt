Balerion skull modification

The skull of the dragon Aegon the Conqueror (also known as the "Black Terror") first appeared in Season 7 of Game of Thrones. In the scene where Cersei and Qyburn descended into the Red Keep's dungeon. And to admit, then the remains of the Black Horror did not make much of an impression.

Whereas in the "House of the Dragon" Balerion really surprises. This structure is nine meters long. Four sculptors worked on it for seven weeks. The peculiarity of the skull is that the iron fittings keep the mouth open, and the thinned teeth create an awesome look. In addition, the sculpture was placed on the altar, adding a sacredness that is important for the Targaryens - and which was not felt at all in IP.
