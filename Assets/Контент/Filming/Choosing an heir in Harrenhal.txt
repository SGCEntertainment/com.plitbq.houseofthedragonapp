Choosing an heir in Harrenhal
The scene was filmed in the throne room. To create the scenery, the film crew painted everything green. From the physical inventory, only the throne and the podium were left, where the candidates for the throne stood - Viserys and Rhaenys. The rest of the paraphernalia was created using computer graphics.

The appearance of the castle is also completely computerized. However, production designers benefit from this. Since Harrenhal is partially destroyed in the Game of Thrones, here the creators gave free rein to the imagination - and came up with new elements of architecture.
