How dragons are made


In some ways, a dragon is easier to draw than people, dogs, or cats. We see people and pets all our life, we know their facial expressions, plasticity in motion. And we have nothing to associate a dragon with, except perhaps with a snake or a lizard, which we never see so large (in the series about the industrial kitchen "The House That Dragons Built" it is shown that the head of a turtle was used as a reference for Vhagar. - Approx. ed.). In the seventh series, when young Eymond approaches Vhagar, we see her eyes, nose, fire in her mouth, and nothing bothers us. We believe it's a dragon because we don't know what nose scales they should have. Plus, the sound makes the perception voluminous.

Even in animation it is very important to transfer the mass. Dragons don't exist, you can't find a documentary about them called In the Animal World. But the man has insight. He could see on TV how an elephant runs, he knows that he has mass, muscles, inertia. The dragon, due to its size, must also move slowly, flutter its wings smoothly (this is also a difficult moment, because a person has seen a lot of birds taking off). These things are technically well done in the series. And you can also see that in the first series, dragons appear a little bit, just to declare this world. But by the end, there are more and more graphics, because they obviously didnâ€™t have time to do everything by the first series and deliberately moved it so that more complex things appear later in order to have time to finish.
