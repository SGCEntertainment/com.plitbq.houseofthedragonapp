The team has updated the Iron Throne. In the House of the Dragon, the throne has become larger and spreads out from it a carpet of swords collected from defeated enemies. This is how the showrunners demonstrate the triumph of the Targaryens.

Please note that these swords are melted - they do not have a clear shape. Decorators took steel rods as a basis and wrapped them with plaster bandages. They hang on rods, creating a sensation of melting. By the way, the team manually processed 2500 swords.
