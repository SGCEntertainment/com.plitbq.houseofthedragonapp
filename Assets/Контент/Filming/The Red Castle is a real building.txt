The Red Castle is a real building
The Dragon House team built a playground that imitates the Red Castle. Although they could have limited themselves to filming in separate pavilions. The castle is 62 meters long, 39 meters wide, with the highest point at 13.5 meters.

But its main feature is that all rooms are united and communicate with each other. Such spacious sets allowed cameramen to shoot in all directions without computer modifications.
