The largest virtual studio in the world
The Volume virtual studio was filming the scene on the walls of Dragonstone, the one in which Rainyra took the dragon egg from Damon. "Volium" is a closed area of ​​two thousand LED screens. There are 92 auxiliary motion capture cameras that are synchronized with the main ones.

In short, this is a new round in filmmaking. The actors saw the work of special effects, virtual scenery and the setting of Dragonstone directly during filming. Of the physical props, only a small piece of the stone wall was left, on which the actors stood. And as Matt Smith admitted, technology has made it much easier to get used to the stage. After all, with a traditional chroma key, the actors think and imagine the situation.
