The site for the jousting tournament was built from scratch

Tournament scenes were filmed on location, with virtually no graphics. To do this, the builders prepared a horizontal platform, leveled the ground and made a "real farmer's field." And in order to gently fall to the actors and stuntmen, everyone was covered with soddy soil.

Filming took place during COVID-19. Therefore, the epidemiological rules allowed a maximum of 150 people on the site, and thousands of extras were needed to crowd the fans. And this is where graphics come in handy. The team got out by recording the actions of one extra, and then multiplying the result by hundreds of people, placing them on the podium.
